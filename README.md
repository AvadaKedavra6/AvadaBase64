# AvadaKedavra - Base64

So I just made a simple Base64 encoder/decoder with python.

Actually i just do it for training at PyQt6 and also base64.

Forgive me if the UI is not very good but i'm still learning this library ^^'

## Installation

How launch it ?

- Install python (I prefer precise it, we never know xd)
- Install PyQt6 with `pip install -r requirements.txt` or just `pip install PyQt6`
- Just open your cmd at the root (where you put the python file) and then write `python main.py`
- And yea thts it !
